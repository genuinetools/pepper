[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/genuinetools/pepper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/genuinetools/pepper)

Named after Pepper Potts. Set all your GitHub repos master branches to be
protected.

You can set which orgs to include and use `--dry-run` to see the
changes before they are actually made. Your user is automatically added to the
repositories it will consider.

Also see [genuinetools/audit](https://github.com/genuinetools/audit) for checking what
collaborators, hooks, deploy keys, and protected branched you have added on
all your GitHub repositories.
